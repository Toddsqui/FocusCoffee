# Focus Cafe Unofficial Website (Chiang Mai, Thailand)

I love coffee as much as the next guy, and Focus Cafe is one of my favorite coffee shops in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The baristas and the owner are just so hospitable and they make a mean cup of joe. This website is my dedication to them. Although it's not the official website of theirs, I thought it was a nice go at version that might get them more customers, who knows? Anyway, I love them so much that I dedicated my time to this. Maybe they'll never know how much I appreciate them, but that's okay. At least they know that I always come back!
